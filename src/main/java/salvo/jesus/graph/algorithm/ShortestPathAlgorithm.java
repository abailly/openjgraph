/**
 * Abstract class for implementing the shortest path algorithm.
 * A shortest path spanning tree is a subgraph of the original
 * weighted graph showing how to reach all other vertices from
 * a given vertex in the same connected set in the shortest possible way.
 * The shortest path between two vertices should be such that the sum
 * of the weights of all the edges between the two vertices be at a minimum.
 * Note that, like minimum spanning trees, there may be more than one
 * shortest spanning tree for a single weighted graph.
 *
 * Concrete subclasses must never modify the weighted graph where
 * it is computing the shortestpath.
